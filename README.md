## Setup Instructions

### üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MySQL server running locally (or Docker)

3. Create two `.env` files:

#### `.env` (for development):
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=job_tracker
```

#### `.env.test` (for test environment):
```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=job_tracker_test
```

> **Note:** Do not commit `.env` or `.env.test` ‚Äî they're already ignored in `.gitignore`.
